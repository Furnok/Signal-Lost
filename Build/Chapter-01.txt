*SHKRRRRRR*-MY GOD! I’ve been stuck here-*SHKRRRRRRRRRRR*-days, it feels so good to hear someone’s voice...+__
*SHKRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR*-any idea what’s going on? Who are y-*SHKRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR*-am I here?+__

<(6)1 - What? I can’t understand half of what you're saying!...__
<(5)2 - Who are you?__

I’m-*SHKRRRRRRRRR*.+ I don’t know how-*SHKRRRRRRRRR*-can't get out...+__

Fuck! The signal’s scram-*SHKRRRRRRRRR*...+ There must be a way to-*SHKRRRRRRRRRRR*... + *snap*+__
...+__
...+__
...+ A-are you there? Can you hear me better?+__

<(7)1 - I think so?__
]

[Scene 7 __
Oh thank god... It’s so nice to hear someone else’s voice.+__
It’s been an eternity since I’ve talked to anyone. Any longer and It would have driven me nuts.+__

<(8)1 - Are you in danger?__
<(9)2 - Where are you?__
<(10)3 - Why did you call me?__
]

[Scene 8 __
I-I don’t know.... I’ve been stuck on this island for two days... or three... Can't even tell anymore...+__
It really looks like I'm the only one, there’s not a living soul here...+__

<(13)1 - Where are you?__
<(15)2 - Why did you call me?__
<(21)3 - Stop. Is that a prank call?__
]

[Scene 9 __
The last few days of my life have been blurry as hell, can’t even remember what day it is!+__
I- I’m all alone on this weird island, I’ve been looking for someone for hours now+__
and all I was able to find is more ruins+__
It- It's like an abandoned city. +__

<(11)1 - Are you in danger?__
<(16)2 - Why call me though?__
<(21)3 - Enough. Are you trying to prank me?__
]

[Scene 10 __
Can’t even tell! I just found this old ass ... flip phone on a shelve, just picked it up and it-+__
it started a call as soon as I opened it!+__
There isn't anything else on that piece of trash, no contacts or any internet access, only this call.+__

<(12)1 - Are in danger?__
<(14)2 - Where are you?__
<(21)3 - Cut it off, just tell that's a prank.__
]

[Scene 11 __
Th-+ the place feels empty as I've said,+ but you don't wake up in a ghost town-looking place and ever feel safe.+__
...+__
Like,+ how does this happen?+__
It's all just like a bad hangover!+__

<(19)1 - Why me of all people?__
<(20)2 - Ok, what's next?__
]

[Scene 12 __
Hard to tell, +...+ but I'm not going to lie, it's hard to not freak out about waking up on a random island...+__
...+__
I-+ Who knows what could be hiding in those buildings? Ha-+ Hard to keep it rational after what happened to me!+__

<(18)1 - Where are you, exactly?__
<(20)2 - And what does that mean for me?__
]

[Scene 13 __
In a mall.+ I figured that if I were to find anything to help me it'd be there...+__
Now I'm going to cross to the other side to see if there's anything in that part of town.+__

<(19)1 - Why'd you call me?__
<(20)2 - I'm sorry, but how can I help?__
]

[Scene 14 __
Oh- Oh yeah, forgot about that...+ I'm in what appears to be the city's supermarket.+__
Went there to find equipment to survive in the first place.+__
And...+ It's almost empty now, and most of the stuff left is either completely busted or covered in trash.+__
...+__
Also the food is molded to the point it makes me sick to my stomach just looking at it.+__

<(17)1 - Survive? Are you in danger?__
<(20)2 - I don't know what to tell you...__
]

[Scene 15 __
Can't even tell myself.+ ...+ I-+ I picked up a random phone I found on a shelf and it called you,__
haven't even dialed your number.+__
...+__
I'm as clueless as you are.+__

<(18)1 - Where are you?__
<(20)2 - So, what do you expect from me?__
]

[Scene 16 __
I found this phone in this supermarket, and simply opening it started the call+__
*Button presses*+__
It doesn't seem to have any app installed, I can't even access the contacts. Calling you was the only thing I could_
do with this dusty relic of a device.+__

<(17)1 - Okay, are you in danger?__
<(20)2 - What could I do about that?__
]

[Scene 17 __
There's no certainty... This place feels so empty. Hauntingly empty, the unnatural kind of loneliness...+__
...+__
I'm being dramatic for a reason.+ It's chilling.+ Something's up with this place.+__

<(21)1 - I don't know, feels kinda hard to believe... It is a prank?__
<(26)2@ - Okay, keep calm, there must be an explanation.__
]

[Scene 18 __
I'm still in the supermarket where I found the phone. Most of the shelves have collapsed, everything is ruined.+__
Apart from the phone, I wasn't able to find anything useful+__
and the food is probably all passed by months or even years from the looks of it.+__

<(21)1 - What's telling me this isn't a bad prank?__
<(26)2@ - Stay connected, I'll help you.__
]

[Scene 19 __
You?+ I don't have any idea. I just found a phone on one of the shelves of this mall.+__
I didn't even call you myself, the call started upon picking it up.+__
...+__
The oddest thing is that the phone was the only piece of tech working+__
that and the way it worked makes me think all of this is orchestrated...+__

<(21)1 - Kind of ruining your credibilty with the conspiracy stuff, that feels like a prank.__
<(26)2@ - Yeah, definitely, let's get you out of here.__
]

[Scene 20 __
I-+ I just need you to stay in call with me.+ For now, you seem to be my only link to the outside world.+__
...+__
And a bit of guidance wouldn't hurt as well, I'm still feeling dizzy from all that mess+__

<(22)1 - I'm gonna call the cops, it really doesn't feel safe.__
<(24)2| - Is it... Really my problem?__
<(26)3 - I still don't really know if I can provide much help, but I'll try...__
]

[Scene 21 __
I swear to god it’s not!!! +__
Listen, seems like you’re the only one I can rely on right now.+__
You’re literally the first person I’ve talked to in the past few hours, or even days!+__
You’re my only way to communicate with the outside world, it’s just a question of my own sanity at this point!+__

<(22)1 - I should call the police.__
<(24)2| - How's that my concern?__
<(26)3 - Okay, I'll try and work something out with you.__
]

[Scene 22 __
PLEASE DON’T HANG UP! I just need someone to talk to!+__
I have no idea if either of us will even be able to call again if you hang up!+__
Wh-+ whatever is happening to me is beyond anything they could believe anyways!+__
...+__
#%IT+ wO+  d bE uS+  LesS. Ke+  p tHe CaLL gO+gOiNg. =#+__

<(23)1 - Yup, I'm calling the police. Hold on, I'll call you back.__
<(27)2 - Okay, okay! Let's not panic.__

]

[Scene 24 __
I have no idea! Your number was on that phone, that’s the only thing I know!+__
You can’t just ignore the fact that you’ve got something to do with this bullshit!+__
You can’t just leave me like that!__

<(25)1 - I have nothing to do with you. Please don’t call me again.__
<(27)2 - Fine...How can I help you?__
]

[Scene 26 __
Oh- Thanks for your understanding, I really appreciate that+__

<(28)1 - I couldn't just leave you there!__
]

[Scene 27 __
Thank god!+ I just...+ Really depend on you right now.+__
I'm sorry to take your time like that but I haven't really got a choice+__.

<(28)1 - Alright, what's next?__
]

[Scene 28 __
O- Okay! ... I gotta get out of the building first, just stay with me.+__
*You hear the person’s footsteps echoing through the supermarket*+__
This place is huge, you don’t realize that until the mall’s empty.+ Just, what happened he-+__
...+__
I hear something.+ Mechanical screeching kind of noise.+__

<(29)1 - Sounds dangerous. Can’t you just go back?__
<(30)2 - Maybe there's someone there ! You should go see where it comes from__
]

[Scene 29 __
I've been exploring this island for hours now and I've find nothing back where I was.+__
It's the first time I hear anything other than the wind or the waves hitting the shore+__
so I'm not turning my back now.+__
If there's any living soul in here that knows what the fuck is going on, I'll just go and talk to them.+__

<(31)1| - You do you. Won't be my fault if you get hurt.__
<(30)2@ - You might be right, any help is welcome at this point.__
]

[Scene 30 __
I hope whatever this is won't be hostile.+__
...+__
... Not gonna lie, I'm kind of shitting my pants right now. I'll try to be stealthy, never too sure...+__
*You hear a quiet breath and the mechanical noise slowly becoming louder*+__

<(32)1 - So? What is it?__
]

[Scene 31 __
Okay, rude?+__
... If you keep talking to me in this tone...+__
You know what, fuck it.+__
I'm going to see where that noise comes from.+__
*footsteps*+__

<(32)1 - Found it?__
]

[Scene 32 __
Shhhh...+__
Wait...+ I-It's an...+__
... It's just a freaking escalator...+__
... It's going weirdly fast, I've never seen an escalator this...+ demented before.+__

<(33)1 - Why is it making this ruckus?__
<(34)2 - Why is it still working in an abandonned supermarket?__
<(35)3 - Where does it lead?__
]

[Scene 33 __
It seems that the engine is overpowered. The escalator goes at a godly speed!+__
It rattles like a goddamn lawnmower.+__
What the-+ I can't even make up where are the steps, it's just so fast it's blurry!+__

<(34)1 - I wonder why this thing is even working.__
<(35)2 - Where does it lead?__
<(36)3 - Try to take a step.__
<(40)4 - Can you see anything that could help?__
]

[Scene 34 __
I've got no idea!+ All that remains here are ruins.+__
Seems weird that the only working thing in this supermarket is a dysfunctionning escalator.+__
Even worse, it's preventing me from getting to the second floor!+__
It almost feels like this was made on purpose...+__
Damn me, I'm making up the worst scenarios in my head now.+__

<(36)1 - Maybe you'll get answers by going to the first floor.__
<(35)2 - Where does it lead?__
<(33)3 - Why is it making this much noise?__
<(40)4 - Is there anything else around you?__
]

[Scene 35 __
I... Can't tell.+__
Oh wait! There is sunlight up here! I think I can access a new part of the island if I go up here.__
Even if I don't think I can go fast enough to compete against this escalator eh!+__

<(36)1 - Nice! Try to climb it then.__
<(34)2 - Why's that still working?__
<(33)3 - Why is it so loud?__
<(40)4 - Can you find anything else?__
]

[Scene 36 __
Hum...+__
Okay? It might lead somewhere interesting.+__
I just have to...+ Take a step at the right...+ Time...+__
WOOAAH SHI- *THUMP*+__
...+__
...+__

<(37)1| - Are you hurt?!__
]

[Scene 37 __
...+__
Ouch...+__
That hurt as hell...+__
What a brillant idea you had ! Stepping on an out of control esc-OUCH! ...+__
Would be nice if you don't advice me to be this idiotic next time... Okay?+__

<(38)1@ - Right, sorry for that.__
<(39)2| - You're the one who decided to listen to me.__
]

[Scene 38 __
Yes, yes...+ No worries.+__
It's just a little scratch, I can handle that.+__
Anyway, there might be a way to stop that thing to go so fast.+__
This escalator seems to be the only way to move forward, so let's search for a solution.+__

<(38)1 - What do you see around you?__
]

[Scene 39 __
Fuck off!__
What tells me you didn't ask me to do that in purpose huh?+__
...+__
I'm overreacting, I just want to get out of here quickly.+__
Let's not be stupid and find a way up here without getting hurt.+__

<(40)1 - Right, right... can't you explore the supermarket then?__
]

[Scene 40 __
Right, uhmmm...+__
There seems to be 2 shelves that aren't empty in here.+__
There is this food section.+ I think I see some food cans and some fruits.+__
I can see a kind of craft section behind me too.+ There might be useful tools in here!+__

<(41)1 - Go to the food section. ;44__
<(42)2 - Go to the craft section. ;43__
]

[Scene 41 __
Okay!+ I'm hungry as hell, I wouldn't say no to a little snack.+__
*footsteps*+ ...+__
*snif*+ OH G-...+ IT SMELLS TERRIBLE OVER HERE!+__
Shelves are filled with rotten fruits and vegeta-...+__
*glurp*+ Oh lord I almost threw up...+__

<(45)1 - Might be a better idea to go to the craft section...__
<(46)2 - Can you keep going? there might be something interesting here.__
]

[Scene 42 __
Right, let's go!+ A good hammer is always useful, especially in the kind of situation I'm in I guess.+__
*footsteps*+__
...Alright! Here I am.+__
There is far less things on the shelves than what I've imagined.+__
There is some door-wedge, packs of rusty nails..__

<(47)1 - Do you see anything else?__
]

[Scene 43 __
"Uhm...+ I don't think going to this section will help me stopping an escalator...+__
I'm going to the Craft section.+ *footsteps*+ ...Alright! Here I am.+__
There is far less things on the shelves than what I've imagined.+__
There is some door-wedge and packs of rusty nails...+__

<(47)1 - Do you see anything else?__
]

[Scene 44 __
You sure?+ I mean, I'm hungry as hell, so I might take a bite if there was anything to eat.+__
*footsteps*...+ *snif*+__
OH G-...+ IT SMELLS TERRIBLE OVER HERE!+__
Shelves are filled with rotten fruits and vegeta-...+__
*glurp*+ Oh lord I almost threw up...+__

<(46)2 - Can you keep going? there might be something interesting here.__
]

[Scene 45 __
Y-you're right... It's best to get out of here before I-...+ *footsteps*+__
...Oof, one more second and I think I would have passed out.+ Anyway, here I am.+__
There is far less things on the shelves than what I've imagined.+__
There is some door-wedge and rusty nails...+ Nothing that could be useful in the end.+__

<(47)1 - Is there something else interesting?__
]

[Scene 46 __
"Yeah, I guess, but it's on-*glurp*...+ Only because you asked me nicely...+__
*footsteps*+ ...Good heavens, aren't these trash supposed to be eaten by the bugs?+__
Wait?+ There's a cereal bar over here that still is good to eat!+__
*crunch*+ yum... thatch good to eat shomething...+*gulp*+ Ah yes, I needed that.+__

<(50)1 - You finished eating? is there anything else here?__
]

[Scene 47 __
I see... a door down the hall.+__
*footsteps*+__
I hear some sound behind it...+ What do I do?+__

<(48)1| - KICK THE DOOR DOWN!__
<(49)2 - Carefully open the door.__
]

[Scene 48 __
Alright. Let's do it the hard way.+__
*KICK*+ POLICE, DON'T MOVE!...+ ouch ouch ouch! My foot hurt as hell now...+__
Great! the door was clearly open ! And there's no one here anyway... This door wasn't worth kicking.+__
It's just a security room.+ Everything seems out of pow-+__
...Oh my bad, seems to be one thing still working!+__

<(51)1 - What is it?__
]

[Scene 49 __
Okay... Carefully...+__
...+Well, there is clearly no one here.+__
It's an old security room it seems, everything is out of power.+__
Oh no, my bad, the beeping sound is coming from here!+__

<(51)1 - There's something beeping?__
]

[Scene 50 __
Let me see...+ Ah AH!+ There's a door over here!+__
There is a sign with "Maintenance Room" marked on it.+__
Lucky me, it seems unlocked.+ *sound of door opening*+__
...+Well yeah,+ that surely looks like a maintenance room, or more like an abandonned maintenance room.+__
...Oh my bad, seems to be one thing still working!+__

<(51)1 - What is it?__
]

[Scene 51 __
I-It's uuuuh...+ A laptop, seems to be on the lockscreen.+__
There's a post-it attached on the upper right corner of it.+ It says "vaccine rabies year"...+__
I don't know when that thing was!+__
...What?+ I don't remember how I got here in the first place, don't expect me to remember this!+__
Anyway, you might want to search for that on the internet, it's a 4 digit password.+ I'll try to log in.+__

<(52)1 - Okay, go on, I'm searching that on my browser.__
]

[Scene 52 __
Just have to press enter and...+__
OH SHIT!!+__
THERE'S A FUCKING TIMER IN HERE, IT'S BEEPING!+__
I think the "vaccine rabies year" shit might be the password, FIND IT NOW!+__
I don't know what will happen if it reaches 0 BUT I DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT!+__
HURRY UP, WHAT'S THE PASSWORD?!+__

<^(53)1 - 1903__

<(56)1 - Are you still alive?__
]

[Scene 56 __
Y-yes?+__
I think I am?+__
...+I don't hear the escalator rumbling anymore, I think we've stopped it.+__

<(57)1 - For real?__
]

[Scene 57 __
I'm going to go and see if that's really what happened...+__
Damn,+ I wonder what would have happened if we didn't type the password in time.+__
It might be better to forget about it right now.+__
*footsteps*+ ...Anyway, I see it from here. The escalator stopped as I was thinking.+__

<(58)1 - You can climb it safely now!__
]

[Scene 58 __
Let's find out!+__
*footsteps*+__
...+Ahah! Yes! There's a door leading outside right here!+__
A bit of sunlight feels good after being in this gloomy supermarket.+__

<(61)1@ - Nice job! What's outside?__
<(59)2 - Okay, so you don't need my help anymore now?__
]

[Scene 59 __
What?+__
I'm still stucked on this island!+ I need your help until I get out of here!+__
I know that you didn't expected to help me today but we're talking about life and death at this point.+__

<(61)1@ - That seems fair, let's move forward.__
<(60)2| - I missed the part where your life's my problem.__
]

[Scene 60 __
*sigh*...+__
I'd like to see you in my position.+ You would have hanged up if all of this didn't pique your interest, right?+__
So stop trying to make everything about you and let's find out what's going on in this island.+__

<(61)1 - You're the one exploring it, tell me what you see!__
]

[Scene 61 __
I think I landed in the main square of the city.+__
The buildings seems more high compared to the one I've seen before+__
There are multiple signs with different types of locations marked on it.+__
And there is something weird at the middle of this place...+__

<(62)1 - What is it?__
]

[Scene 62 __
It's...+__
A huge mechanical trapdoor.+__
There's a huge "EXIT" word tagged on it.+__

<(63)1@ - That's it! That's your way out!__
<(64)2 - Too obvious… It's a trap.__
]

[Scene 63 __
AHAHAHAH!+ You're right!+__
Now, how do I open this thing?+__
There are no visible handles and it looks far too resistant to be opened with my bare hands.+__
Please tell me tha-… Oh!+ There's a command pannel over here!+__
…+There's clearly a fuse missing here...+__

<(66)1 - So, you're going to search for it?__
]

[Scene 64 __
Y-You might be right, but that's the first time I see something that brings me hope of getting out of here.+__
If there is a single chance that this trapdoor brings me back to civilization, I'll do everything to open it.+__

<(65)1 - Can you open it then?__
]

[Scene 65 __
Well… There's no handle attached to it anywhere...+__
HNNG!+ huff...+ I can't open it with my bare hands neither.+__
It seems locked by some kind of electrical mechanism that leads to this control panel+__
...+There's clearly a fuse missing here...+__

<(66)1 - You're going to search for it?__
]

[Scene 66 __
I don't know, but it's our only lead for now, so I'll make it my main objective from now on!+__
...+I don't know where to start now...+__

<(72)1 - Maybe check what's around?__
<(67)2 - Wasn't there a fuse back in the supermarket?__
]

[Scene 67 __
No, I checked pretty much every shelves while I was inside and there was nothing but dust on them+__
There might be other interesting locations out there.+__
#%SeA+rCh wE+LL=#__

<(68)1| - Are you sure you can't go back in the supermarket?__
<(72)2 - Okay, let's check what's here then.__
]

[Scene 68 __
Can't you just trust me for a second?+__
I told you I checked everything, this damn place back then was filled with ruins and nothing more.+__
...+There are signs leading to 2 different locations in here. On is leading to a factory and the other to a zoo.+__

<(70)1 - Is there not any other location you can go to? ;73__
<(69)2 - In which do you want to go?__
]

[Scene 69 __
Uuuh...+__
I don't know...+ You're the one that got me out of the supermarket, so I'll let you choose!+__
Where do you want me to go explore?+__
The Zoo or the Factory?+__

<$03 1 - Let's go to the Zoo!__
<$04 2 - Let's go to the Factory!__
]

[Scene 70 __
I can search a bit more since you're nice...+__
Oh!+ My bad.+ There is an hidden sign behind the bushes.+ It says "Museum"+__
Here you go!+ A third location to explore.+__

<(71)1 - So, where are you heading then?__
]

[Scene 71 __
Uuuh...+__
I don't know...+ You're the one that got me out of the supermarket, so I'll let you choose!+__
Where do you want me to go explore?+__
The Zoo, the Factory or the Museum?+__

<$03 1 - Let's go to the Zoo!__
<$04 2 - Let's go to the Factory!__
<$02 3 - Let's go to the Museum!__

[Scene 72 __
Hmmm... The buildings here look exactly the same compared to the one I crossed before calling you...+__
Hey!...+There are signs leading to 2 different locations in here.+__
On is leading to a factory and the other to a zoo.+__

<(70)1 - Is there not any other location you can go to? ;73__
<(69)2 - In which do you want to go?__
]

[Scene 73 __
I would have said that there were more signs if that was the case.+__
So, no, there's nothing else here. What then?+__

<(69)1 - Right. Where are you heading?__
